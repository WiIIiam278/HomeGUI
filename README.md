## HomeGUI for HuskHomes
This plugin is a fork of [HomeGUI](https://github.com/TechnoVisionDev/HomeGUI) with support for [HuskHomes](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/HuskHomes2) instead of EssentialsX. It provides an interactive GUI interface for HuskHomes homes. In other words, it's an add on for HuskHomes that changes the chat home list to a GUI with customisable home icons.

This plugin supports HuskHomes v2.3+. To install it, simply download HuskHomes and this plugin and place them in your plugin directory.

## Notes
* This plugin has some light configuration (changing messages and available icons), with text configurable using [MineDown](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown) formatting.
* This plugin saves the icon data locally through yaml files. It does not support syncing your home icon preference between servers. In the future, I plan on giving you the option to have home icons be player heads or have the icon be based on a seeded random number, the seed being the home and owner name (thus the same cross-server).
* This plugin does not support HuskHomes warps... yet.
