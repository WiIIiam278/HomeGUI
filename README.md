## HomeGUI for HuskHomes
This plugin is a fork of [HomeGUI](https://github.com/TechnoVisionDev/HomeGUI) with support for [HuskHomes](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/HuskHomes2) instead of EssentialsX. It provides an interactive GUI interface for HuskHomes homes.

This plugin supports HuskHomes v2.3+. To install it, simply download HuskHomes and this plugin and place them in your plugin directory.

## Notes
* This plugin saves the icon data locally through yaml files. It does not support syncing your home icon preference between servers through a database... yet.
* This plugin has some light configuration (changing messages and available icons) but does not support MineDown... yet.
* This plugin does not support HuskHomes warps... yet.
